# Chronicler
Chronicler is an offline-first web browser. Chronicler works as your own personal:

- Web archiver, snapshotting pages exactly as you remember them.
- Search engine, providing full-text search of all pages you visit.
- Web crawler, automatically downloading entire sites to be browsed later.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Early development warning

Chronicler is functional but very early in development. Many features you might expect from a web browser have not yet been implemented. Your feedback is welcomed! Some features that have not yet been implemented include:

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything (back/forward, open location, new tab).
- Opening links in new tabs (you have to manually open a new tab presently).
- Importing and exporting WARC files for interoperability.
- Collections of pages, to restrict searching and manage disk space.
