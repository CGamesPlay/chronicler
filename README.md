# Chronicler
Chronicler is an offline-first web browser. Chronicler works as your own personal:

- Web archiver, snapshotting pages exactly as you remember them.
- Search engine, providing full-text search of all pages you visit.
- Web crawler, automatically downloading entire sites to be browsed later.
